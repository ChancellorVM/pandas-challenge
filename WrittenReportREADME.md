The five highest-performing schools by passing rate were all charter schools and four of the top five were categorized as small or medium-sized, with the lone exception being Wilson High School. By contrast, all of the top-five worst-performing schools were large district schools. Spending per student did not impact performance as much as school size did. There was also a clear difference between district and charter schools, as charter schools had passing rates in the 90s while district schools only had just over half of their students pass.

What this data tells us is that what distinguishes the best-performing schools from the worst-performing schools is size. With smaller student populations, small and medium-sized charter schools are able to focus more on each individual student in order to make sure they are comfortable with the material and prepared for examinations. Meanwhile, the district schools are required to handle more students, resulting in less attention paid to the needs of each individual student - with some students falling through the cracks. Reducing the size of each school could possibly allow for district schools to match the success rates of their charter counterparts.
